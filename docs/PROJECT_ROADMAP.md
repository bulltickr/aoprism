# AOPRISM Platform Roadmap 🌖

AOPRISM is a Parallel Reactive Intelligent System Mesh for AO. This roadmap transitions from our successful Alpha release (v1.0) into the future of decentralized edge intelligence.

---

## ✅ Phase 1: The Core Platform (Completed v1.0)

We have successfully built the "Infinite Terminal" for AO, including:

### 1. Unified Infrastructure
- **MCP Server Hub**: Exposes 37 AO tools via a universal model context protocol.
- **Rust Secure Enclave**: Hardware-backed cryptographic security (WASM-based).
- **Hardened AO Client**: Standardized ANS-104 messaging for HyperBEAM compatibility.

### 2. Flagship Features
- **AI Agent Composer**: Visual drag-and-drop builder for AO agents.
- **AI Copilot**: Intelligent development assistant with Lua generation & security auditing.
- **AO Testing Framework**: Isolated execution environment for contract verification.
- **Process Marketplace**: Protocol for discovery, reviews, and dependency resolution.
- **Multi-Chain Bridge**: Aggregator for cross-chain liquidity (deBridge, Across).

## 🚀 Roadmap 2.0 (The Future)

With the core platform complete, we focus on scaling utility and decentralization.

### 🌐 Cross-EVM Connectivity
- **EVM Signer Integration**: Native support for Ethereum/L2 signatures within the Secure Enclave.
- **Unified Identity**: Link AO addresses with ENS and Lens profiles.
- **Bridge Expansion**: Direct liquidity paths to Stargate and Wormhole.

### 🗳️ Decentralized Governance & Reputation
- **On-Chain Reviews**: Move the marketplace review system to an AO process for immutable reputation.
- **DAO Tooling**: Visual templates for launching and managing AO DAOs.
- **Treasury Management**: Multi-sig support via holographic state auditing.

### 🧠 Advanced Edge Intelligence
- **Large Language Model Support**: Upgrade from SLM to high-performance LLMs via WebGPU.
- **Collaborative AI**: Multi-agent swarms that coordinate through AO processes.
- **ZK-Knowledge Graphs**: Privacy-preserving indexing of the AO state.

### 🌌 Future Horizons (The Perma-OS)
- **Spatial & Voice Interface**: 3D spatial UI and voice-activated agent commands via `browser_media`.
- **Native Integration**: Mobile-native ports for seamless on-the-go permaweb access.
- **Autonomous Infrastructure**: Sponsored spawn backends and health-monitored gateways for frictionless onboarding.
