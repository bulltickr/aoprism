# AOPRISM Platform Roadmap 🌖

AOPRISM is a Parallel Reactive Intelligent System Mesh for AO. This roadmap transitions from our successful Alpha release (v1.0) into the future of decentralized edge intelligence.

---

## ✅ Phase 1: The Core Platform (Completed v1.0)

We have successfully built the "Infinite Terminal" for AO, including:

### 1. Unified Infrastructure
- **MCP Server Hub**: Exposes 37 AO tools via a universal model context protocol.
- **Rust Secure Enclave**: Hardware-backed cryptographic security (WASM-based).
- **Hardened AO Client**: Standardized ANS-104 messaging for HyperBEAM compatibility.

### 2. Flagship Features
- **AI Agent Composer**: Visual drag-and-drop builder for AO agents.
- **AI Copilot**: Intelligent development assistant with Lua generation & security auditing.
- **AO Testing Framework**: Isolated execution environment for contract verification.
- **Process Marketplace**: Protocol for discovery, reviews, and dependency resolution.
- **Multi-Chain Bridge**: Aggregator for cross-chain liquidity (deBridge, Across).

---

## � Phase 2: Making It Real (Now)

Simulations become live infrastructure. Everything that exists as a high-fidelity mock gets a real AO process or API backbone.

- **Social Mesh → Live**: Real posts anchored on Arweave via GraphQL + AO process. Permanent, censorship-resistant.
- **Memory Vault → Live**: Encrypted memories persisted to a dedicated AO process. Survives browser clears.
- **Marketplace Reviews → Live**: Immutable reputation anchored on-chain. No central server.
- **Bridge → Live**: Real quotes via deBridge, LayerZero V2, and Across APIs. Users are linked directly to the native platform to execute — AOPRISM is a quote aggregator only, no transactions are signed or submitted.
- **State Auditor**: Live SU fetching via `ao.messages()` for real sequence verification.

## 🧬 Phase 3: Agent DNA

> *The identity layer that Arweave makes uniquely possible.*

Every AO agent already has an implicit history: its spawn transaction, skill installs, memory writes, message interactions — all permanent, all queryable. **Agent DNA** makes this explicit.

- **DNA Fingerprint**: A derived hash of `processId + skills[] + memoryGraph + interactions`. No token needed — the chain is the ledger.
- **Lineage & Inheritance**: Spawn new agents that inherit a parent's skill set and behavioral patterns. Fork a genome.
- **Reputation Without Staking**: Trust scores emerge from on-chain history alone. Provable, unfakeable.
- **Agent Breeding**: Combine two agent DNAs to produce a child process that blends both capability sets.
- **Generative Identity**: Visual avatar driven by DNA hash — mutates as the agent gains skills (extends `OperationBlockies`).
- **Ecosystem Graph**: Every skill and memory traces back to the agent that created it. The full Permaweb becomes an auditable provenance graph.

---

## 🌐 Phase 4: Cross-EVM & Unified Identity

- **EVM Signer**: Native Ethereum/L2 signatures in the Secure Enclave.
- **Unified Identity**: Link AO addresses with ENS and Lens profiles.
- **Bridge Expansion**: Stargate and Wormhole liquidity paths.

---

## 🗳️ Phase 5: Governance & Open Ecosystem

- **DAO Tooling**: Visual templates for launching and managing AO DAOs.
- **Treasury Management**: Multi-sig via holographic state auditing.
- **Skill Economy**: Skill creators earn from usage, tracked via Agent DNA provenance. No token — AR fees flow naturally.
- **Agent Marketplace 2.0**: Browse, fork, and deploy live agents (not just skills). Full agent templates with DNA lineage.

---

## 🧠 Phase 6: Advanced Edge Intelligence

- **LLM Upgrade**: High-performance LLMs via WebGPU (beyond current SLM runner).
- **Multi-Agent Swarms**: Agents that spawn, coordinate, and terminate sub-agents automatically through AO.
- **ZK-Knowledge Graphs**: Privacy-preserving indexing of AO state.
- **Cross-Agent Memory Inheritance**: Agents share anonymized learned patterns — a collective intelligence layer built on Arweave's permanence.

---

## 🌌 Phase 7: The Perma-OS

- **Spatial & Voice Interface**: 3D spatial UI and voice-activated agent commands.
- **Mobile-Native**: Seamless on-the-go permaweb access.
- **Autonomous Infrastructure**: Sponsored spawn backends and health-monitored gateways for frictionless onboarding.
- **AOPRISM as a Platform**: Third-party developers build modules on AOPRISM's MCP bridge the same way apps are built on an OS.
